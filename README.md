# ContriBot

ContriBot is a cool little tool for those whom wish to be grateful for their Open Source contributors. [@SendGrid](http://twitter.com/sendgrid) has several libraries where awesome people submit fixes and we have decided to award them with patches!

In order to automate the process of sending stuff, I built a bot which will verify every time a merge has been applied to master. The bot will later collect the users data and post it in all the desired backends (basecamp, trello, lob, email). 

This is still **on-going development**. Deployment instructions will soon be release and a guide on how to contribute to different backends.
